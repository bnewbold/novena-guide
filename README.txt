This is Sphinx-based documentation, built from reStructured Text sources. Build
locally with ``make html`` (you'll need the ``python-sphinx`` package or
equivalent on your platform). The output will pop out at
``_build/html/index.html``.

The live version (currently at https://novena-guide.readthedocs.org/) is hosted
by ReadTheDocs using github hooks for auto builds. For context, and pointers
for how to make changes and contributions, see
https://docs.readthedocs.org.

The sources are hosted at https://github.com/bnewbold/novena-guide.
Contributions by patch or pull-request are welcome! Please indicate that you
agree with the licensing terms. If you don't want to use the github system, you
can send patches or plain text corrections or comments to "bnewbold" at the
domain of "robocracy.org".

The documentation infrastructure supports both multiple variants (eg, tweaked
docs for derivative or future hardware) and translations. If you'd like to help
with a translation it's probably best to get in touch first to make sure
efforts aren't duplicated.
